# covid-genetic-analysis
Delve deep into the intersection of biology and computer science and analyze how Sars-CoV-2 jumped from animal to human, identify the differences between strains and how it affects transmission, and create a phylogenetic tree documenting the evolution of the virus. Biology experience/coursework preferred, but not required.
